### Hi there! 👋 I'm @ja-shuvro

I'm a **Full Stack Developer** specializing in creating dynamic, high-performance applications. With a solid background in both front-end and back-end development, I enjoy building full-scale solutions from scratch and optimizing existing systems for scalability and efficiency. 

- 🔭 **Tech Stack**: 
   - **Backend**: Node.js, Nest.js, Express.js
   - **Frontend**: React.js, Next.js, HTML5, CSS3, TailwindCSS, SCSS
   - **Database**: MongoDB, MySQL, Sequelize ORM, Mongoose
   - **Languages**: JavaScript, TypeScript
   - **Tools & Technologies**: Git, RESTful APIs, JSON, Postman, Docker

- 🌱 **Currently Exploring**: 
   - Advanced **TypeScript** practices and design patterns
   - **Microservices architecture** for large-scale applications
   - **Cloud deployment** and **DevOps** integration for seamless CI/CD pipelines

- 💡 **What I love doing**:
   - Building robust, scalable **backend APIs** with Node.js and Nest.js
   - Crafting responsive and intuitive **front-end interfaces** using React and TailwindCSS
   - Writing clean, maintainable code that scales well
   - Implementing database models and optimizing query performance with **MongoDB** and **MySQL**

- 👀 **I’m interested in**: Collaborating on open-source projects, contributing to full-stack web applications, and helping startups build MVPs or scale their platforms.

- 💞️ **Let’s Collaborate**: I’m always open to working on **backend APIs**, **front-end apps**, or anything that involves **JavaScript, TypeScript**, or **Node.js**. If you have an idea or a project, I’d love to help!
